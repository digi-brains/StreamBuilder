# StreamBuilder

## What it is
StreamBuilder is an automated build environment well suited for HTML, CSS and JavaScript prototyping. It runs on the (streaming) build system [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and comes with goodies like the [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) CSS extension language and the [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) template language.

## What it does

By working in the `/src` directory all of your changes are piped and rendered to the `/dist` folder.

- `/src/scss` -> `/dist/css`
- `/src/js` -> `/dist/js`
- `/src/pages` -> `/dist/`
- `/src/img` -> `/dist/img`
- It even refreshes your browser on every change!
